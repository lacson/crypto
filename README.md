# crypto
A small cryptography library  
Author: Jonathan Lacson (@lacson)

## Ciphers Done
More will be done as the course progresses.

- Shift
- Substitution
- Affine
- Vigenere
- Permutation
- Hill (requires Numpy!)

## Mathematical Utilities Provided
I know that [sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) probably
provides these and more, but these were done for my own benefit
to keep up with a cryptography course I am taking.

I've tested these functions myself, but I do not guarantee their
reliability at this stage of development. I'll go back and provide
test scripts for them one day...

- Euler's Totient
- Modular Multiplicative Inverse
- Index of Coincedence
